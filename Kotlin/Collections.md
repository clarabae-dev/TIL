#### Overview  
Kotlin distinguishes between mutable and immutable collections (lists, sets, maps, etc).  
- Immutable Collections  
A read-only interface that provides operations for accessing collection elements.  
- Mutable Collections  
A mutable interface that extends the corresponding read-only interface with write operations:  
adding, removing, and updating its elements.
